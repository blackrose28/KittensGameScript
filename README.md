Kittens Game Scripts

If you want to use this, feel free to bookmark:

    javascript:(function(){var d=document,s=d.createElement('script');s.src='https://rawgit.com/MaPaul1977/KittensGame/master/ScriptKitties.js';d.body.appendChild(s);})();

or just paste it directly into the console.

Currently this script will automatically do the following:

1) Build  * Note: Lets you choose which buildings you would like auto built.
    
2) Craft   * Note: Lets you choose what level of fur-based items you would like crafted.

3) Hunt
4) Trade
5) Praise

In addition, it does 2-4 only once the corresponding resources are maxed. This allows you to come back to the game whenever you like and still be able to use your resources.

It also allows you to check your paragon efficiency on the fly.

Special thanks to both AutoKittens and KittenScientists for some of the ideas I integrated into this script.

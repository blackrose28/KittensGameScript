Kittens Game Scripts

If you want to use this, feel free to bookmark:

    javascript:(function(){var d=document,s=d.createElement('script');s.src='https://rawgit.com/MaPaul1977/KittensGame/master/ScriptKitties.js';d.body.appendChild(s);})();

or just paste it directly into the console.

Currently this script will automatically do the following:

1) Build
2) Craft
3) Hunt
4) Trade
5) Praise
6) Research Science
7) Upgrade Workshop

In addition, it does 2-4 only once the corresponding resources are maxed. This allows you to come back to the game whenever you like and still be able to use your resources.

The button to get to the ScriptKitties option menu is in the bottom right "footer" links.

Special thanks to both AutoKittens and KittenScientists for some of the ideas I integrated into this script.
